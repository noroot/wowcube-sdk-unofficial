# WowCube SDK Unofficial 

This is unofficial SDK for [https://wowcube.com](WowCube).

## Diff

* Plain structure
* Uses Make 
* Remove clutter (VScode, Processing distro was inside repository which bad practice.)

## How to

`make build` - compile pawn
`make amx` - starts 8 instances of pawnrun with compiled amx code 
`make emu` - starts Processing emulator

## Flaws

* Newst version of PawnCC doesn't work with current official SDK code
